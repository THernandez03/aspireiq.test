### How to run it
- Just run `npm run dev`

_Note: Make sure you have the port `3000` available_

### Improvements
- Add more Test files and improve the existing ones
- Implement a real server
- Implement a real request to the server
- Move the Dropdown to the right position
- Select Dropdown items using the keyboard

### Suggestions
- I think all the emails that already was added, should be shown always with the background and the close button instead of only when the mouse is hovered, because that way permit the user understand that is in a different state than the one that is being filled, also permit the user have a general view of how remove them

- When there is an error in the label, should be a close button.
